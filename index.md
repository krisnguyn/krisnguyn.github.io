## Top 3 favorite labs in CPSC 120L
* Lab 4
  This was a favorite lab because I enjoyed all the parts and my partner for this lab. In part 1, it was fun creating and learning how to create a calculator calculating the metric unit of volume. Part 2 was great since it was a fun little guessing game that required using if-statements.

* Lab 6, Part 2
  Lab 6, part 2, was a favorite because I always wondered how the game of Blackjack operated. It was fun learning how the game works and making a calculator for it. It was satisfying having a fully operational calculator that calculates the value of each given hand.

* Lab 7, Part 2
  Lab 7, part 2, was a favorite because of the challenging parameters that were given. It was also fun interpreting each given sign and creating if statements according to those rules and regulations. I learned and experimented with if-statements and the positive increment functions.
